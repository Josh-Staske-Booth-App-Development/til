Going to review the basics and keep notes to myself here today.


key string methods

.upcase #goes all uppercase
.downcase #goes all lower case
.gsub("Thing you want to replace", "what you want to replace it with") #to replace things, use in combination with / / regularal expressions i.e. regex for advanced string filtering
.length
.reverse
.swapcase
.chomp #removes the /n new line character at the end
.strip #removes any whitespace at the end
.capitalize gives you back a string with just the first character capitalized

.to_s #changes to a string
.to_i #changes to an integer
.to_f #changes to a float

.split #splits a string into an array THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL

.include?()

get a string from a user input by using gets, strip out whitespace on the end with gets.chomp

interprolate a string with #{} inside the string to call variable or do math for example "One plus three is equal to #{1 + 3}"


#INTEGERS

+ - * / % are all mathmatical operators on integers
and int is and int not a float. They have a decimal at the end i.e. 2.2 instead of the integer 2

.odd?
.even?

rand(n) #calls a random number between 0 and n - 1

#FLOATS

.round 

#Date

Ruby has a built in class for dates so you don't have to use any kind of string to store it!
